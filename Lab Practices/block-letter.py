# Block Letters
# ASCII art is a way of creating images using the individual characters from a keyboard.

# For example, below is an ASCII art of some letters from the English alphabet.

# In this project, we will write a Python program that displays the initials of your name in block characters to dip your toes into the world ASCII art.


# Let’s start by writing two comments:

# Your full name
# Stephanie Payumo

# A fun fact about yourself
# I love learning new skills

# Now that we have our name down, let’s output our first initial!
# Try printing out the first character of your first or given name as a block character!

print(" SSS    PPPP")
print("S    S  P    P")
print("S       P    P")
print(" SSS    PPPP")
print("     S  P")
print("S    S  P")
print(" SSS    P")
